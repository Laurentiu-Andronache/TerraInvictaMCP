        // faction list -- cachedFleet1's, plus cachedFleet2's when fleet2 holds, else
        // cachedHab's coreFaction -- must contain no null (IL_0189) and be exactly two
        // long (IL_0192). Fail any of those and the method archives the combat, removes
        // it from the GameStateManager and calls SpaceCombatManager.SetCombat(null)
        // (IL_0459-IL_0473). InitializeCombat never runs, Autoresolve is never reached,
        // and the combat is simply gone the next frame.
        //
        // So a genuine two-fleet fight needs both fleets valid, both carrying at least

        // Each clause is dominated by a refusal that fires earlier, and the window in
        // which a failing gate could be observed does not exist.
        //
        //   cachedFleet1 null or not Valid -- InitiateCombat passes `this` straight
        //     through to CacheCombatAssets (IL_0644), and combat.start's `attacker`
        //     had to resolve as a live TISpaceFleetState to get there.
        //   cachedFleet2 null -- InitiateCombat nulls its target only when the caller
        //     passed null or a `deleted` state (IL_0029-IL_003d), and combat.start
        //     requires a `defender` that resolves.
        //   either fleet with no ships -- spawn.fleet enforces ships 1..20, and no
        //     verb empties a fleet without deleting the fleet with it.
        //   a null faction -- FleetFaction refuses both sides first.
        //   a faction count other than 2 -- the same-faction refusal rules out 1, and
        //     AddUniqueFaction adds at most one entry beyond fleet1's.
        //
        // Nor can the gate be caught failing later. Promotion is not deferrable:
        // SimulationTimeTick.OnUpdate reaches the promotion scan at IL_007d down both
        // arms of its Paused test (IL_0034/IL_0039 gates only the idle-AI block), so a
        // combat created by combat.start is promoted or archived before any subsequent
        // bridge call can read it. The one state that skips the scan --
        // SpaceCombatManager.HasActiveState() true, IL_0083/IL_0088 -- is exactly the
        // state in which InitiateCombat parks the request on the fleet's

        // creating a TISpaceCombatState at all, so there is no combat to read a gate
