    //
    // A councilor mission's contested resolution, evaluated without running it.
    // The mission phase is the only place the engine calls these itself, and it
    // calls them with a councilor already assigned, a target already validated
    // and a clock already frozen; a rule that lives as a patch on either method
    // is otherwise reachable only by playing to a mission and waiting for the
    // phase. This calls both directly, so the patched path runs with none of
    // that timing.
    //
    // Both are safe to call out of phase, which is why this verb can exist:
    //
    // TIMissionResolution_Contested.GetSuccessChance draws no random number and
    // writes no campaign state. It is not pure: GetAllModifiers AddRanges the
    // resolution template's OWN persistent attackingModifiers and
    // defendingModifiers instances rather than copies (only the trait, context
    // and campaign-difficulty modifiers are constructed per call), and
    // TIMissionModifier_ResourceSpent.GetModifier stores its resource argument
    // into a field on one of those shared instances before computing. That
    // write is the engine's own idiom -- the mission panel drives it the same
    // way every time it refreshes -- and it decides nothing but the modifier's
    // own display name, so calling out of phase is safe. It is stated here
    // because "pure" is the licence this verb runs on, and it would be wrong.
    //
    // ONLY THE TARGET-VALIDITY ZERO IS GATED. The method opens
    // `ldarg.s 5; brfalse.s IL_001f`, and IL_001f is the councilor.active test:
    // reValidateTarget == false jumps PAST the target validation and INTO the
    // active check. So an inactive councilor returns 0.0 at every setting of
    // `revalidate`, which is why councilorActive is reported unconditionally --
    // a detained or dead councilor otherwise reads as a suppression rule
    // firing, on exactly the claim this verb exists to prove.
    //
    // GetMissionOutcome mutates nothing either, but it CONSUMES the RNG: one
    // RandomFloatValue draw, plus a second RandomRange draw when the councilor
    // is turned. That is the whole reason `outcomes` defaults to 0 and `seed`
    // exists. TIUtilities' generator and its stored-state stack are both
    // [ThreadStatic] and every verb runs on the main thread, so a push here
    // cannot disturb the AI planner's threadpool work -- and the planner's own
    // GetSuccessChance calls touch no RNG in any case. PopRandomState throws on
    // an empty stack, so the pop is in a finally and is only ever made when the
    // matching push was.
    //
    // GetMissionOutcome also recomputes the chance itself, with
    // reValidateTarget hard-coded false at its IL_0006. A roll therefore cannot
    // honour `revalidate`, which is what rollChance below reports.
