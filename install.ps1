Clients: claude (Claude Code, this game folder only), opencode (OpenCode,
global), antigravity (Antigravity, global).

Claude Code's registration covers this game folder and nothing else, so when it
is the only supported client found on PATH it is registered without asking. A
global registration (OpenCode, Antigravity), and any repoint of an existing
registration, is asked for, default No.

With no console to prompt at (piped, scheduled task, CI) those are left alone
unless -Register (or -Yes) says otherwise.

Environment:
  TI_ROOT      the Terra Invicta folder. Defaults to three levels up
               (Mods\Enabled\<mod>); set it when this checkout lives
               somewhere else.

Unity Mod Manager: with the Assembly install method, a game update reverts its
injection into TerraInvicta_Data\Managed\UnityEngine.UIModule.dll. This script
detects that and names the fix -- re-run UnityModManager.exe, pick Terra
Invicta, choose the Assembly method, click Install -- and does not repair it
itself. (The Linux install.sh can, through UMM's console installer under mono;
there is no such path here.) A DoorstopProxy install (winhttp.dll and
doorstop_config.ini in the game folder) has nothing to revert and is reported
as it is.
