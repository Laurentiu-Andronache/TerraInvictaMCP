# Builds TerraInvictaMCP.dll from every .cs under src/. Needs mono-mcs and an

# game's Managed folder).
#
# -nostdlib against the game's own assemblies is deliberate: system Mono's
# profile places some BCL types in different assemblies than Unity's Mono, and a
# typeref emitted against the wrong assembly is a TypeLoadException at runtime.
# Never add system references to make a build error go away.

# The game root is three levels up (Mods/{Enabled,Disabled}/<mod>); TI_ROOT

usage: build.sh [-h|--help]
Compiles every .cs under src/ into TerraInvictaMCP.dll, written next to this
script (Mods/Enabled/TerraInvictaMCP/), which is where the game loads it from.
Restart the game to pick up a new build.
  -h, --help   this message
Requirements:
  mcs          Mono's C# compiler (package mono-mcs, or mono-devel). Without
               it the build exits 3 and the shipped DLL is used as-is.
  a Terra Invicta install with Unity Mod Manager already installed: the build
  references the game's own assemblies under TerraInvicta_Data/Managed,
  including UnityModManager/UnityModManager.dll and 0Harmony.dll.
Environment:
  TI_ROOT      the Terra Invicta folder. Defaults to three levels up
               (Mods/Enabled/<mod>); set it when this checkout lives
               somewhere else.
