Clients: claude (Claude Code, this game folder only), opencode (OpenCode,
global), antigravity (Antigravity, global).

Claude Code's registration covers this game folder and nothing else, so when it
is the only supported client found on PATH it is registered without asking. A
global registration (OpenCode, Antigravity), and any repoint of an existing
registration, is asked for, default No.

With no terminal (piped, cron, CI) those are left alone unless --register= (or
--yes) says otherwise.

Environment:
  TI_ROOT              the Terra Invicta folder. Defaults to three levels up
                       (Mods/Enabled/<mod>); set it when this checkout lives
                       somewhere else.
  UMM_INSTALLER_DIR    the unpacked Unity Mod Manager installer (the folder
                       holding Console.exe), used to repair the mod loader
                       when a game update reverts its injection (the Assembly
                       method). Needs mono. Without it the script reports the
                       reverted injection and names the manual fix. A Doorstop
                       install has nothing to revert and is reported as it is.
