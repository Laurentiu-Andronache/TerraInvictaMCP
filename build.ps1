# Builds TerraInvictaMCP.dll from every .cs under src\. Needs a C# compiler and
# an installed Unity Mod Manager (its UnityModManager/0Harmony live under the
# game's Managed folder).
#
# Compiler probe order: Mono's mcs on PATH, then a Roslyn csc on PATH.
#
# The .NET Framework compiler every Windows install carries at
# C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319\csc.exe is DETECTED AND
# REFUSED, deliberately. It is the pre-Roslyn compiler and accepts C# 5 at most,
# while src\AiControl.cs uses nameof (C# 6), so invoking it can only produce a
# page of syntax errors that name a language feature and not the real problem.
# Refusing it up front turns that into one line naming the remedy. Do not "fix"
# this by deleting the guard: put a Roslyn csc or mcs on PATH instead.
#
# csc on PATH is checked the same way, because that well-known folder is
# sometimes on PATH. "csc -version" is the discriminator: Roslyn prints a
# version and exits 0, the in-box compiler rejects the switch and exits nonzero.
#
# -nostdlib against the game's own assemblies is deliberate: a system C#
# profile places some BCL types in different assemblies than Unity's Mono, and a
# typeref emitted against the wrong assembly is a TypeLoadException at runtime.
# Never add system references to make a build error go away.
#
# The game root is three levels up (Mods\{Enabled,Disabled}\<mod>); TI_ROOT
# overrides it for out-of-tree checkouts.

  -Help        this message
Requirements:
  a C# compiler on PATH: Mono's mcs, or a Roslyn csc (the one shipped with
  Visual Studio, the Build Tools, or the .NET SDK). The in-box
  C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319\csc.exe is detected and
  REFUSED: it is pre-Roslyn, accepts C# 5 at most, and the sources use C# 6,
  so it can only produce syntax errors that name the wrong problem.
  a Terra Invicta install with Unity Mod Manager already installed: the build
  references the game's own assemblies under TerraInvicta_Data\Managed,
  including UnityModManager\UnityModManager.dll and 0Harmony.dll.
Environment:
  TI_ROOT      the Terra Invicta folder. Defaults to three levels up
               (Mods\Enabled\<mod>); set it when this checkout lives
               somewhere else.
Run from this folder:  powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File build.ps1
