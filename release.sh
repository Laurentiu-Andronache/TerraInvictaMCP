Builds the DLL and packages release/TerraInvictaMCP-<version>.zip, whose only
top-level entry is the folder TerraInvictaMCP/, so it unzips straight into
Mods/Enabled/. The version comes from ModInfo.json.
  --no-build   package the DLL already in the folder, skipping build.sh
  -h, --help   this message
In the zip: ModInfo.json, TerraInvictaMCP.dll, README.md, LICENSE, install.sh,
install.ps1, build.sh, build.ps1, src/, server/*.py, server/tests/*.py and docs/*.md.
Out of it: .git, .gitignore, .gitattributes, .github/, AGENTS.md, SECURITY.md, __pycache__,
*.cache, the generated modcheck_*.dat caches, and release/ itself. Everything
shipped is copied by name, so nothing new lands in a release by accident.
