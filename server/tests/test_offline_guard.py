"""The guard that keeps this suite away from a running game.

  python3 -m unittest discover -s server/tests

The defect it exists for is a case that passes for the wrong reason. A case
reaching tools.handle_call or compose.pause_gate without a fake bridge dials
127.0.0.1:17470, and with the game down that connection is refused instantly:
the call raises, the code takes the failure path, and the assertions hold. Run
the same case next to a running game and it reads that session instead -- a
campaign parked past the pause limit answers with the PAUSE LIMIT banner, a
live DLL answers a spawn verb with its own argument error -- so the suite
passes or fails on what is on a screen somewhere else. Four cases did exactly
that.

The guard turns the silent case into a loud one. These cases are what keeps it
armed: an unimported guard is no guard, and an ordinary exception would be
swallowed by the three `except Exception` blocks handle_call wraps around
dispatch.
