"""Unit tests for what decides a smoke test's verdict, for the sweep that
collects those verdicts, and for the combat tool's orphan check.

  python3 -m unittest discover -s server/tests

The classifiers share a failure mode: they decide, silently, that something is
not worth reporting. A log line wrongly allowlisted turns a real defect into a
pass, and a begin-combat prompt wrongly identified gets a live one dropped off
the queue. Neither shows up anywhere downstream.

The sweep has one of its own. It is the longest-running tool here, minutes per
scenario, and the game can die inside any of them; a sweep that let that end
the call threw away every scenario it had already tested and never reached the
ones after.

None of it needs a game, a bridge or game assemblies.
