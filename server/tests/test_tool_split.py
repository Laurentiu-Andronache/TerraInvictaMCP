"""Unit tests for the three tools that read and wrote through one name.

  python3 -m unittest discover -s server/tests

`faction_relations`, `ui_view` and `ui_screen` each served a bare read form and
an argument-driven write from the same tool, so each had to be marked a write
in the tool table. The pause gate reads that column: a write is refused over a
stopped clock and a read runs with the banner. Reading a paused campaign's
relations, or asking which screen is up, was therefore refused -- a guard
against building state over a dead clock, stopping the calls that build none.

Each tool is now one or the other, and what holds the split is here: the reads
refuse the arguments that would write, the writes refuse a call with nothing to
do, and `ui_status` is both UI reads in one answer. A defect in any of those
reads as a tool that quietly does something other than its annotation claims,
which nothing downstream catches.

Nothing here needs a running game.
