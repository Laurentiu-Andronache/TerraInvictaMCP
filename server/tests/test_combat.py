"""Unit tests for the combat_autoresolve wait.

  python3 -m unittest discover -s server/tests

The wait polls combat.status until the machine disarms, and then decides
whether a standing begin-combat prompt is an orphan to drop. Both halves read
the same status, so a poll that never answered is the dangerous input: taken
as a reading it says "nothing armed, no combat left", which is a clean resolve
followed by a prompt drop on a fight that is still on screen waiting for a
button.

No running game is needed. The fake answers the four verbs the wait calls,
and the clock is virtual so a poll costs nothing.
