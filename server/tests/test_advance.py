"""Unit tests for the advance loop.

  python3 -m unittest discover -s server/tests

Two layers. The decision helpers decide how long a hold is tolerated, what the
caller is told when it is not, and how a dropped narrative event is named;
each used to be an expression buried in the loop, where a wrong answer looks
like a patient run or a stale sentence and nothing downstream catches it. The
loop itself runs against a fake bridge, which is the only way to test what a
call REPORTS: a run that dies quietly does so by reporting a stall as a budget,
an unreadable queue as an empty one, or a busy game as a dead one.

Neither layer needs a running game.
