"""Is the code this process is running the code that is on disk?

The MCP server is a long-lived Python process the client spawns once and
keeps for the whole session. Editing server/*.py changes nothing in it: the
files are read at interpreter start and never again. Every other signal
reports health while that is true -- the DLL build is current, the unit suite
runs the new files, and version agreement passes because the mod version does
not move during development -- so a run can spend hours reading answers
produced by code that was replaced before it began.

The record has to be taken when the code is loaded, not when the check runs.
A check that hashes a file at check time and compares it against that same
file agrees with itself no matter what happened in between, which is the
failure this module exists to catch. So `note()` snapshots each server module
the first time this process is seen holding it, and never re-snapshots; only
`drift()` reads the disk again.

Content hashes, not timestamps: git checkout, a copy, or a formatter rewrite
moves an mtime without changing a byte, and a false stale verdict costs the
same reconnect as a real one.
