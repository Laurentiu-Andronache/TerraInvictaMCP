"""Stdout-hygiene check for the MCP stdio server.

  python3 server/stdio_selfcheck.py

The MCP transport is newline-delimited JSON-RPC on stdout, so ANYTHING else
written there -- a stray print, a warning, a traceback, a progress line --
corrupts the stream and the client drops the connection, usually with a parse
error naming a character rather than the module that emitted it. Clients do
not recover.

This drives a real server subprocess through initialize, tools/list,
resources/list, a resource read, and several tools/call requests (modcheck
among them, since modcheck.py is imported by tools.py and is the largest body
of code that could print), then asserts that every line the server wrote to
stdout parses as JSON-RPC. It needs no running game: a tool call that reaches
the bridge comes back as a tool error, which is still a well-formed response
and is exactly as good a carrier for stray output.

Exit 0 when the stream is clean, 1 when it is not (offending lines quoted),
2 on a harness failure.
